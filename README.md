# Cryptography - secret writing üñ•Ô∏è

## **What is cryptography ?**
It is a technique for sending secure messaging.
  'or' 
process of converting ordinary plain text into cypher text and vice-versa.

#### The sender uses an encryption algorithm , and the receiver uses a decryption algorithm 
### What is Key ??
A 	**key** is a number (value) that the cipher , as an algorithm , operates on. 
```
In cryptography ,the encryption /decryption algorithms are public; the keys are secret. 
```
## TYPES OF cryptography? 
- Symmetric-key Cryptography 
- Asymmetric Cryptography
## Symmetric-key Cryptography 
In Symmetric-key cryptography , the same key is used by the sender (for encryption) and the receiver (for decryption) . The key is shared.
